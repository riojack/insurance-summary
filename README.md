# Insurance Definitions
This repository contains data specifications on which the insurance company performs its business processes, including: claims handling, adjusting, and settling.  

Each specification is tailored toward business precision and not technical precision.  Because of this, software developers and architects have creative license to adapt the specifications for technical precision.  In doing so, however, business precision must not be lost.  That is, the technical implementation must fulfill *at least* the business precision.
