# Damage
Presently, damage is categorized into one of the following damage types:

* Direct front damage
* Indirect front damage
* Direct rear damage
* Indirect rear damage
* Driver side damage
* Passenger side damage
* Fauna (animal) damage
* Weather damage
* Vandalism, theft, or other criminal-related damage

A vehicle can be damaged in more than one category.  When this occurs, an adjustment is made for each category of damage on the vehicle.

## Damage Value
Damage is assessed on a scale from 1 to 200.  1 typically means no damage and 200 means a total and catastrophic loss.

## Effect on Settling
Damage is corrolated with the policyholder's coverage and details from the adjustment to come up with a final money value to be paid out.  For example, if a vehicle is assessed at a total loss (value of 200), and the cost to replace is $30,000, and the policyholder has $100,000 protection coverage, then the settled value is $30,000.  For the same scenario, if the policyholder has $20,000 protection coverage, then the settled value is $20,000.
