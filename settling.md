# Settling

Based on the claim details and the adjustment details, the insurance company can calculate the settlement.  A settlement details what is covered, what is not covered, and what the pay-out base value will be.

Here there be rules, which decide the outcome.

## Types of Damage

Damage to a vehicle can be considered **DIRECT** damage or **INDIRECT** damage.  Straightline damage occurs when an impact is directly on the front or back bumper with any amount of force.  Indirect damage occurs when an impact occurs on the trunk, bed, trailer, or engine compartment but not straight on the bumper.

Damage to a vehicle can also occur to the cab of the vehicle.  This is categorized as **SIDE** damage, and can happen on the driver's side or the passenger's side.  It is not important whether the damage occurred to the rear portion of the cab or the forward portion.

Finally, other types of damage can occur as well: theft, fauna, and weather.

## Value of Damage

The damage has a value associated with it-- not a monetary value, but a numeric value.  The numeric value indicates the nature of the damage.  For example, for direct damage, a 2 indicates minor damage but a 200 indicates severe damage that resulted in severe injury or death, and the vehicle was totaled.

For other types of damage, such as theft, a 2 indicates a theft of, say, a hub cap but a 200 indicates theft of the entire vehicle.
